* Bridge Design Pattern implemenation in PHP

* Bridge Design Pattern: is used when we need to decouple an abstraction form its implementation so that the two can 
* vary independently. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern. 
* This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge which makes the functionality of concrete classes 
* independent form interface implementer class. Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting 
* each other.
