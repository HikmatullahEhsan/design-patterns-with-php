# Design Patterns with PHP

Design Patterns: The practical implementation of design patterns in PHP, including creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

## 1. Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with object composition and typically help you ensure that your classes and objects are properly structured for ease of use and scalability. Examples include:

- Adapter Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Proxy Pattern

## 2. Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects and how they interact and work together to perform tasks. Some of the commonly used behavioral design patterns in PHP are:

- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Memento Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- State Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- Visitor Pattern

## 3. Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with the object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Common examples of creational patterns include:

- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern
- Prototype Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
